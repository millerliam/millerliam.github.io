      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Liam Miller, and I am a second-year data science student at Northeastern University. I am from Arlington, Virginia, near Washington D.C. I am currently working on a sports analytics project, where my partner Daniel Ku and I are building a model to try and predict the outcome of the Northeastern Women’s Hockey Team’s games, and we are only allowed to use publicly available data. I am proficient in Python and C++, and am currently learning HTML. I am used to working in a team, and for that, I have used GitHub and Google CoLab.</p>
      <p>In the past, I have worked as a camp counselor for Levine School of Music, as a youth soccer referee, and as an intern at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. I plan to apply to Data Science Co-ops through Northeastern for the Fall of 2025, and I plan to graduate with 2 Data Science co-ops before entering the field. I am a member of the Sports Analytics Club, and some of my other sports of interest are football, basketball, and tennis. I want to learn more about machine learning and I am planning to do so in the coming months.</p>
