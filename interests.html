      <h2>My Passion for Learning About the World</h2>
      <p>One thing that I am passionate about is learning about the world and all of its countries. From a young age, I’ve always been passionate about this and I carried around a pocket atlas in first grade and would read it anytime that I got the chance. I know almost all of the countries from a blank map and know most of their flags/capitals as well. I believe that we can learn a lot from understanding each country and its history. The past should be used to help us guide ourselves for the future, and we should learn what to do and especially what not to do from it. I think that is something that is really important, especially in the present day.</p>

      <p>Every country has a unique culture that gives it something that everywhere else does not have, which is why I love traveling. So far, I have been to Paris, London, and various places in Greece, Italy, Quebec, the Caribbean, and the United States. I always look forward to adding more places to that list, and my dream destination is Iceland. I would love to go in any season, either in the summer when there is daylight for 24 hours, or in the winter to see the northern lights, but hopefully I get to do both in my lifetime!</p>
