I didn't know how to submit both the website and the .js and .html files for part 2, so I just put them in this github.

For the design elements: The website has been customized by incorporating two custom fonts, Roboto for the body text and Merriweather for headings, which give a clean and stylish appearance. The color scheme has been updated, with a blue background for the header and footer, white text, and hover effects on links that change from white to yellow or orange. The layout has been improved by setting a maximum width for the content, adding padding and margins for better readability, and applying box shadows and rounded corners to create a polished look. Images are styled to be responsive, automatically scaling to fit different screen sizes, and the navigation bar has been customized with spacing and hover effects to make it more user-friendly.
